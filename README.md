### Hello World 👋 🌎

- 👾 I am an aspiring **Backend Developer**
- 🔭  I’m currently doing my Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech (Part-time) and a Post-Graduate Diploma in Mobile App Development at Conestoga College - Waterloo, ON, Canada.
- ⚡  Fun fact: I found a loophole on facebook that allows anyone to send a message as anyone using fake mail headers, when I was 13.
